# Installation

During the development process, dependency management and packaging are handled using <a href="https://python-poetry.org/" target="_blank">Poetry</a>. When the API is released, you will be able to install it with `pip install lexos-api`. Other methods of installation will be added to this page at a later date.

## Installing the Lexos API with Poetry

A Mac-centric approach to installing Poetry is as follows:

```linux
$ brew install poetry
$ poetry --version
Poetry version 1.1.11
```

The Poetry website contains extensive documentation on [how to install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) on different operating systems.

My running theory is that the best way to install the Lexos API prior to release is to complete following steps:

1. Install Poetry.
2. Clone the repo.
3. `cd` to the local repo directory.
4. Run `poetry init`.

This is as yet untested. If you are only evaluating the API and not modifying the code base, you can probably just clone the repo and run the library locally by following the instructions below.

## Running the Development Library Locally

Although you can call the Lexos API from command-line scripts or the Python command line, the easiest method is to call it from a Jupyter notebook. However, you may find that Jupyter has trouble finding the module if it has not been added to your Python environment. There is an easy workaround for this.

1. `cd` to the directory containing the API. If you cloned the repository, this will be the `lexos` folder (not the `lexos` subfolder inside it).
2. Then fire up `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`.
3. In the first cell of your notebook, run the following code:

```python
import os
import sys
LEXOS_PATH = "lexos"
if "NOTEBOOK_INITIATED_FLAG" not in globals():
    NOTEBOOK_INITIATED_FLAG = True
    try:
        module_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), os.pardir)
    except:
        module_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(LEXOS_PATH))
        %cd lexos
        %pwd
    if module_path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(module_path)
```

If you are starting your notebook from another directory, you can modify `LEXOS_PATH` to point to the `lexos` subfolder.

You should now be able to import the `lexos` API module from your local directory.
