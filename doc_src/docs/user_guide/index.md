# User Guide

The User Guide is designed to provide an explanation of the features of the Lexos library. It is aimed at users who are new to the library and want to understand what it can do and how to use it effectively. Each section of the guide will cover a specific feature, providing examples and explanations to help users get started, as well as tips for more advanced usage. The discussion is designed to provide a conceptual basis for Lexos, its underlying principles and technologies, so that users can apply Lexos tools in their own projects. The User Guide is also intended to be a comprehensive resource for users of all levels, from beginners to more advanced users. It contains many code samples; however, when introducing functions, it does not provide examples of every possible setting or configuration. For more detailed information on specific functions, users are encouraged to refer to the [API documentation](../api/index.md).

The User Guide is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect or module of the Lexos library. You can navigate through the sections using the links in the sidebar. Within pages, a table of contents on the right allows you navigate between sections on the page to explore individual topics.

## Requirements

The Lexos library requires Python 3.12 or later. If you are running Lexos on your own machine, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python packages. For development, we use the `uv` package manager, which simplifies dependency management and packaging. You can install it by following the instructions on the <code><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" target="_blank">uv</a></code> website. However, Lexos should work in any Python 3.12+ environment.

## Installation

All of Lexos' dependencies are downloaded when Lexos is installed. For installation instructions, please refer to the [Installation Guide](../installation.md).
