# LexosDoc

A wrapper class for a spaCy doc which allows for extra methods.

A convenience that allows you to use Doc extensions without the
underscore prefix.

!!! note

    There is probably no need for this class. We can just keep a
    library of functions in a file called `tokenizer.py` and import them.
    If certain functions get used commonly, they can be turned into Doc
    extensions.
