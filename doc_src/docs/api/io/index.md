The IO module manages input and output functions. It contains two loader modules: `smart` and `dataset`. The `smart` provides an interface for loading texts in a variety of formats, whether from local files or from urls. The `dataset` module provides method for loading or downloading large numbers of texts that are generally stored in a single file.
