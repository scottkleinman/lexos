# Milestones

Milestones are specified locations in the text that designate structural or sectional divisions. A milestone can be either a designated unit *within* the text or a placemarker inserted between sections of text. The Lexos `milestones` module provides methods for identifying milestone locations by searching for patterns you designate. There three modules for different kinds of milestones:

- [`string_milestones`](string_milestones.md)
- [`span_milestones`](span_milestones.md)
- [`token_milestones`](token_milestones.md)
