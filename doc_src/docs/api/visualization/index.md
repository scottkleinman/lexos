# Visualization

This module contains the Lexos visualization functions. It has three submodules: `bubbleviz`, `cloud`, `plotly`, and `seaborn`. The first two create bubble charts and word clouds. The second two provide functions for using specific Python libraries. The `plotly` submodule has `cloud` and `cluster` methods for producing interactive word clouds and cluster plots (dendrograms and clustermaps). The `seaborn` module contains functions for producing static clustermaps.
