    "Topic modeling is a statistical method for discovering abstract themes or \"topics\" within a collection of documents. MALLET is the most-widely used tool for topic modeling in the Humanities. It is a Java package which needs to be installed separately from Lexos. However, the Lexos `mallet` module provides an easy way to call MALLET, manage its outputs, and generate some simple visualizations of your topic model. For more on topic modeling, as well as instructions for installing MALLET, see Shawn Graham, Scott Weingart, and Ian Milligan's tutorial [Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet)."

    "## Visualizing Topic Trends Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot_topics_over_time()` method in the Mallet class allows you to visualize how the probability of a specific topic changes across a sequence of documents, such as those ordered by time or another variable. This is useful for exploring temporal or sequential patterns in your corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `times`: (list) Sequence of time points or other ordering variable, one per document.\n",
    "- `topic_index`: (int) The topic to plot (0-based index).\n",
    "- `topic_distributions`: (list[list[float]], optional) Topic distributions per document. If None, uses the model's distributions.\n",
    "- `topic_keys`: (list[list[str]], optional) Topic keys. If None, uses the model's keys.\n",
    "- `output_path`: (str, optional) If provided, saves the figure to this path.\n",
    "- `figsize`: (tuple, optional) Size of the figure (default: (7, 2.5)).\n",
    "- `font_scale`: (float, optional) Seaborn font scale (default: 1.2).\n",
    "- `color`: (str, optional) Line color (default: \"cornflowerblue\").\n",
    "- `show`: (bool, optional) If True, displays the figure; if False, returns the matplotlib Figure object.\n",
    "- `title`: (str, optional) Title for the figure. If not supplied, uses topic keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `times` list must be the same length as the number of documents.\n"
