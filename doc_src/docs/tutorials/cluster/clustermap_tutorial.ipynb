    "### Generating the Clustermap \n",
    "\n",
    "A clustermap is produced using Seaborn, a Python data visualization library built on top of `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create the clustermap, we need to provide it with our document-term matrix and tell it how to measure distances and how to arrange the clusters. Here are the some of the key parameters you can adjust:\n",
    " \n",
    "- `metric`: This tells the dendrogram how to measure the \"distance\" or dissimilarity between your documents. The default \"euclidean\" is good for general comparisons but can be sensitive to the overall length of documents (longer documents might naturally have larger term counts, increasing their \"distance\"). Using \"cosine\" similarity is commonly used for documents of different length because it focuses on stylistic or thematic *direction* rather than raw word counts. The \"cityblock\" metric is also commonly used when individual differences in term counts are important. See the Lexos User Guide for further discussion.\n",
    "- `method`: The linkage method determines how individual documents (or existing clusters of documents) are joined together to form larger branches and clusters in the tree. The default \"average\" linkage setting considers the average distance between *all* pairs of documents in the two clusters. The \"single\" linkage setting joins clusters based on the *closest* pair of documents between them. It can sometimes lead to \"chaining,\" where documents connect one after another, forming long, straggly branches. By contrast, \"complete\" linkage joins clusters based on the *furthest* pair of documents between them. This tends to produce more compact, clusters, ensuring all documents within a cluster are relatively similar to each other. The \"ward\" linkage setting aims to minimize the increase in \"variance\" (or spread) within clusters when they are merged. It tries to make clusters that are as \"tight\" and internally similar as possible. See the Lexos User Guide for further discussion.\n",
    "- `labels`: A list of descriptive names for your documents (e.g., \"Poe\", \"Lippard\").\n",
    "- `z_score`: Standardizes the values within each row (documents) or column (terms). If the value is set to `None`, the heatmap shows raw frequencies (or whatever your DTM contains). The setting `0` standardizes each row (document) by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This highlights how *terms vary within a single document* relative to that document's average term frequency. Useful for comparing patterns across documents regardless of their length. The setting `1` standardizes each column (term) by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This highlights how *a single term's frequency varies across different documents* relative to that term's average frequency. Useful for seeing which documents use a term more or less than average.\n",
    "- `standard_scale`: Similar to `z_score`, but scales to a specific range (usually 0 to 1). The setting `0` scales each row (document) so its minimum value is 0 and its maximum is 1. The setting `1` scales each column (term) so its minimum is 0 and its maximum is 1.\n",
    "- `title`: Adds a title to your dendrogram plot.\n",
    "- `figsize`: A tuple `(width, height)` in inches to set the size of the overall figure. For example, `(12, 8)` for a wider and taller plot.\n",
    "\n",

This allows you to mouse over individual sections of the heatmap to see which documents are represented by that particular section. Also, by adjusting the height of the heatmap, it can be easier to say the labels for all terms. Note that the dendrograms and heatmap are separate subplots, so panning and zooming occurs separately.
