Ainsworth_Guy_Fawkes,"KINGSTON LISLE, BERKS. MY DEAR MRS. HUGHES, You are aware that this Romance was brought to a close during my last brief visit at Kingston Lisle, when the time necessary to be devoted to it deprived me of the full enjoyment of your society, and, limiting my range--no very irksome restriction,--to your own charming garden and grounds, prevented me from accompanying you in your walks to your favourite and beautiful downs. This circumstance, which will suffice to give it some interest in your eyes by associating it with your residence, furnishes me with a plea, of which I gladly avail myself, of inscribing it with your name, and of recording, at the same time, the high sense I entertain of your goodness and worth, the value I set upon your friendship,--a friendship shared in common with some of the most illustrious writers of our time,--and the gratitude I shall never cease to feel for attentions and kindnesses, little less than maternal, which I have experienced at your hands. In the hope that you may long continue to diffuse happiness round your own circle, and contribute to the instruction and delight of the many attached friends with whom you maintain so active and so interesting a correspondence; and that you may live to see your grandsons fulfil their present promise, and tread in the footsteps of their high-minded and excellent-hearted father,--and of _his_ father! I remain                     Your affectionate and obliged friend,                            W. HARRISON AINSWORTH.       KENSAL MANOR HOUSE, HARROW ROAD,               _July 26, 1841_."
