    "\n",
    "Plotly clustermaps are somewhat experimental and may not render plots that are as informative as Seaborn clustermaps. One advantage they have is that, instead of providing labels for each document at the bottom of the graph, they provide the document labels on the x and y axes, as well as the z (distance) score in the hovertext. This allows you to mouse over individual sections of the heatmap to see which documents are represented by that particular section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the clustermap object has been instantiated, it can be displayed with the `Clustermap.showfig()` method. However, this is currently generating an error in some installations of Jupyter notebooks and in VS Code notebooks. If you call `Clustermap.fig` instead, you will still get the error, but you will see the clustermap displayed beneath it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative method is to save the figure to an html file and then open the html file in a browser. The cell below does just that by telling Lexos that the `output_type` should be a file and that the file should be called `clustermap.html`. You can change the filename or location by modifying the `filename` variable. The easiest method (although it produces a large file) is to have Lexos include the Plotly JavaScript, so `include_plotlyjs` is set to True. Methods of reducing the file size are outside the scope of this tutorial. The `auto_open` parameter tells Lexos to automatically open a new browser tab and display the clustermap."
