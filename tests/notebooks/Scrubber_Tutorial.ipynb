    "`Scrubber` is a \"preprocessing\" module which can help you clean up your data to make it suitable for further analysis. It is important to remember that `Scrubber` operates using patterns and has no awareness of the language of the text other than the implicit knowledge you bring when you decide how to use it. As a result, `Scrubber` may not always have the desired results. Make sure you inspect the output before using it for your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrubber can be defined as a \"destructive preprocessor\". In other words, it changes the text in ways that potentially make mapping the results onto the original text potentially impossible. It is therefore best used before other procedures so that the scrubbed text is essentially treated as the \"original\" text."

Remember that the effects of `Scrubber` are destructive, so the order in which components are combined can often make a difference in the output. The `make_pipeline()` and `pipe()` functions are used to set up the pipeline."
