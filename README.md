The Lexos API is a library of methods for programmatically implementing and extending the functionality in the <a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/" target="_blank">Lexos</a> text analysis tool. Eventually, the web app will be rewritten to use the API directly. The goal of this alpha stage of development is to reproduce (and in some cases extend) the functionality of the current web app.

## üìñ Documentation

A full discussion of the use of the API can be found on the [Documentation](https://scottkleinman.github.io/lexos/) website.

A suite of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/scottkleinman/lexos/tree/main/tests/notebooks).
