Once you have generated a document-term matrix, it becomes easy to convert it to pandas dataframe and then to use any of the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html" target="_blank"><code>pandas.DataFrame.plot</code></a> methods, or to export the data for use with other tools. However, the Lexos API has a number of built-in visualisations to make the process easier. These are accessed through the `lexos.visualization` module. By default, all Lexos visualisations are _static_ plots produced with the Python `matplotlib` library. However, both static and interactive plots can be produced using third-party libraries like Plotly and Seaborn. These can be imported from their own folders within the visualisation module. For instance, the Plotly dendrogram module can be imported with `from lexos.visualization.plotly.cluster import dendrogram`.

Each of the available visualisation types is described below.

!!! warning
    Currently, there is some inconsistency with respect to the format of the input data for dendrograms. Wherever possible, the document-term matrix (the output of `lexos.dtm.DTM`) is used. Generally, the visualisation function will then call `dtm.get_table()` to retrieve the data as a pandas dataframe. However, in some cases, the visualisation function requires the dataframe table to be format of input document. Eventually, these functions will be made consistent.

## Word Clouds (and Variants)

### Single Word Clouds

The simplest way to generate a word cloud is to import the `wordcloud` function from [lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud][] and pass it a document-term matrix.

```python
from lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud import wordcloud
dtm = DTM(segments, labels)
wordcloud(dtm, opts, figure_opts)
```

Wordclouds are generated by the Python [Wordcloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) library. Options can be passed to `WordCloud` using the `opts` parameter. Figures are generated using Python's `matplotlib`, and its options can be passed using `figure_opts`. Both take a dictionary of options, as in the example below:

```python
opts = {
    "max_words": 2000,
    "background_color": "white",
    "contour_width": 0,
    "contour_color": "steelblue"
}
figure_opts = {"figsize": (15, 8)}
wordcloud = wordcloud(dtm,
    opts=opts,
    figure_opts=figure_opts,
    round=150,
    show=True,
    filename="wordcloud.png"
)
```

The `round` parameter (normally between 100 and 300) will add various degrees of rounded corners to the word cloud.

If a `filename` is provided, the plot will be saved to the specified file. By default, `show=True`, and the wordcloud will be plotted to the screen if the environment is appropriate. If `show=False`, the `WordCloud` object will be returned. In this instance, you can still save the word cloud by calling `wordcloud.to_file(filename)`.

By default, [lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud][], creates a word cloud based on the total term counts for all documents. If you wish to use a single or a subset of documents, use the `docs` parameter.

```python
wordcloud(dtm, docs=["doc1", "doc2", etc.])
```

!!! note
    [lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud][] takes a number of other input formats, including raw text, but a `lexos.dtm.DTM` is by far the easiest method to generate data from pre-tokenised texts.

### Multiclouds

Multiclouds are grid-organised word clouds of individual documents, which allow you to compare the document clouds side by side. The method of generating multiclouds is similar to word clouds. The basic input is a `lexos.dtm.DTM` object, where one word cloud will be generated for each document. If a subset of documents is required, the `docs` parameter shown above should be used. Once the data is prepared, the multiclouds are generated as showb below:
with a [lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud.multicloud][].

```python
from lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud import multicloud
labels = dtm.get_table().columns.tolist()[1:]
multicloud(dtm, title="My Multicloud", labels=labels, ncols=3)
```

Since multicloud produce multiple subplots, there is a `title` parameter to give the entire figure a title and a `labels` parameter, which includes a list labels to be assigned to each subplot. In the example above, we are just taking the labels from the DTM, minus the first "terms" column. The `ncols` parameter sets the number of subplots per row.

If a `filename` is provided, the entire plot will be saved. If `show=False`, [lexos.visualization.cloud.wordcloud.multicloud][] returns a list of word clouds. These can be saved individually by calling `to_file()` on them.

!!! note
    As with word clouds, [lexos.dtm.wordcloud.make_multiclouds][] takes a number of different input formats, but pandas dataframes are the easiest to work with.

### Bubble Charts

Bubble charts (known as "bubbleviz" in Lexos) are produced as follows:

```python
from lexos.visualization.bubbleviz import bubbleviz
bubbleviz(dtm)
```

See [lexos.visualization.bubbleviz][] for a description of the various options.

!!! warning
    The algorithm to produce bubble charts in pure Python is experimental and not nearly as good as the Javascript implementation used in the Lexos app.

### Dendrograms

Static dendrograms based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering are produced using the [lexos.cluster.dendrogram.Dendrogram][] class. It operates directly on the document-term matrix.

```python
dendrogram = Dendrogram(dtm)
dendrogram.fig

or

dendrogram = Dendrogram(dtm, show=True)
```

The dendrogram plot is not shown by default, so you need to use one of the methods above to display it. The class is a wrapper around <code><a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html">scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram</a></code>, and you can change any of its options by calling them, e.g. `dendrogram.orientation = bottom`. If you change any of the options, you must then rebuild the dendrogram by calling `Dendrogram.build()`.

The distance title, distance metric, and linkage method, of the dendrogram can be set in the same way by passing `title`, `metric`, and `method` when instantiating the class or by setting them afterwards in the same manner as shown above.

There is also a `savefig()` method which takes a filename or filepath to save the file. The image format is detected automatically from the extension type.

### Plotly Dendrograms

To create a dendrogram in plotly, do the following:

```python
from lexos.visualization.plotly.cluster.dendrogram import PlotlyDendrogram
layout = dict(margin=dict(l=20))
dendrogram = PlotlyDendrogram(
    dtm,
    title="Plotly Dendrogram",
    x_tickangle=45,
    **layout
)
```

The `plot()` function accepts the `labels`, `colorscale`, `hovertext`, and `color_threshold` parameters in the <code><a href="https://plotly.github.io/plotly.py-docs/generated/plotly.figure_factory.create_dendrogram.html">plotly.figure_factory.create_dendrogram</a></code> function. However, it requires strings, rather than functions, for the names of distance metric and linkage method, as shown above. Use the `x_tickangle` parameter to change the rotation of the leaf labels.

A dictionary of <a href="https://plotly.com/python/configuration-options/">Plotly configuration options</a> can be passed to the `config` parameter. Likewise, <a href="https://plotly.com/python/reference/layout/">Plotly layout options</a> can be passed using the `layout` parameter, as shown in the example above.

Once the dendrogram object has been instantiated, it can be displayed with the `Dendrogram.showfig()` method it can also be converted to HTML with `Dendrogram.to_html()`. By default, this will return an HTML div element, but the `output_type` can also be set to "file" and a `filename` supplied to save the HTML string as a file.

!!! warning
    If you create a dendrogram with something like `dendrogram = Dendrogram(dtm, show=False)` and then call `dendrogram.fig`, you will get a plot, but it will not have any configurations you have specified applied to it. This includes the default configurations such as removing the Plotly logo from the menubar. This is due to a flaw in Plotly's API. Accessing the dendrogram figure with `dendrogram.showfig()` avoids this problem.

### Seaborn Clustermaps

A clustermap is a dendrogram attached to a heatmap, showing the relative similarity of documents using a colour scale. Lexos can generate static clustermap images using the Python Seaborn library.

To generate a clustermap, use the following code:

```python
from lexos.visualization.seaborn.cluster.clustermap import ClusterMap
cm = ClusterMap(dtm, title="My Clustermap")
```

[lexos.visualization.seaborn.cluster.clustermap.ClusterMap][] accepts any <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html"><code>Seaborn.clustermap</code> parameter.</a>

The distance title, distance metric, and linkage method, of the dendrogram can be set in the same way by passing `title`, `metric`, and `method` when instantiating the class or by setting them afterwards calling `ClusterMap.build()`.

The clustermap plot is not shown by default. To display the plot, generate it with `show=True` or refernce it with `ClusterMap.fig`. If you change any of the options, you must then rebuild the dendrogram by calling `ClusterMap.build()`.

There is also a `savefig()` method which takes a filename or filepath to save the file. The image format is detected automatically from the extension type.

### Plotly Clustermaps

Plotly clustermaps are somewhat experimental and may not render plots that are as informative as Seaborn clustermaps. One advantage they have is that, instead of providing labels for each document at the bottom of the graph, they provide the document labels on the x and y axes, as well as the z (distance) score in the hovertext. This allows you to mouse over individual sections of the heatmap to see which documents are represented by that particular section.

Plotly clustermaps are constructed in the same manner to Plotly dendrograms:

```python
from lexos.visualization.seaborn.cluster.clustermap import PlotlyClustermap
clustermap = PlotlyClustermap(dtm)
clustermap.showfig()
```

All the options for Plotly dendrograms are available with the following differences:

- Figure size is determined by configuring the `width` and `height` parameters.
- `colorscale` is the name of a <a href="https://plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/" target="_blank">built-in Plotly colorscale</a>. This is applied to the heatmap and converted internally to a list of colorus to apply to the dendrograms.
- Two additional parameters, `hide_upper` and `hide_side` allow you to hide the individual dendrograms.

!!! warning
    Once the clustermap plot has been generated, it is inadvisable to use the modebar zoom and pan buttons because this tends to separate the heatmap from the dendrogram leaves. It may even be advisable to remove these buttons from the modebar by default.
