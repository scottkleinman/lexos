    "# Mann-Whitney Test for Term Distinctiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sample implementation of the Mann-Whitney test (AKA Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) for term distinctiveness in a corpus of documents. The test is used to determine if the distribution of term frequencies in two different sets of documents is significantly different. It makes a useful alternative to the z-test.\n",

    "In the next cell, import the `MannWhitney` class from the `topwords` module. We will use this class to calculate the Mann Whitney U statistic and its p-value. The function takes two dataframes as input. The first is the data grouping for which the the results of the test will be reported. The second is the the data grouping to which the first will be compared. The function returns a ranking statistic and a p-value for each term. The highest ranked terms are the ones that are most distinctive to the first data grouping. An additional function provides the option to add some statistics showing the relative frequency of the terms between each grouping.\n",

    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability that a test statistic is extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming that the two samples come from the same distribution. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the observed difference between the two samples is statistically significant, and we conclude that the two samples do not come from the same distribution.\n",

    "By default, the table displays the average frequency of terms in the control group along with the increase in frequency in the comparison group. This provides us with another view of how important the word is to the sample and its relative over- or under-usage in comparison to the other sample."
