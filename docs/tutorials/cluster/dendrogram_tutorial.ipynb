    "\n",
    "Now for the exciting part: generating and displaying your Dendrogram! This tree visually represents the relationships between your documents based on the numerical data in our DTM.\n",
    " \n",
    "When we create the `Dendrogram`, we need to tell it how to measure document similarity and how to connect those similarities into a tree. Here are the key parameters you can adjust:\n",
    " \n",
    "- `dtm`: This is our \"linguistic spreadsheet\" (`dtm`) that we created in the previous step. It's the essential input for the tree.\n",
    "- `metric`: This tells the dendrogram how to measure the \"distance\" or dissimilarity between your documents. Shorter distances mean more similar documents.\n",
    "    - `\"euclidean\"` (default): Think of this as the \"straight-line\" distance between two points on a graph. It's good for general comparisons but can be sensitive to the overall length of documents (longer documents might naturally have larger term counts, increasing their \"distance\").\n",
    "    - `\"cosine\"`: Imagine each document as an arrow pointing in a specific linguistic \"direction.\" Cosine similarity measures how much these arrows point in the same direction. If they point almost identically, the documents are very similar, even if one document is much longer than another. This is often an excellent choice for text analysis as it focuses on stylistic or thematic *direction* rather than raw word counts.\n",
    "    - `\"cityblock\"` (also called Manhattan distance): Imagine moving on a city grid where you can only go along streets (no diagonal shortcuts). This distance is the sum of the absolute differences for each term between two documents. Useful when the individual differences in term counts are important.\n",
    "    * Many other metrics are available (e.g., \"jaccard\", \"chebyshev\"). You can find a full list in the SciPy documentation for `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `method`: Once we've measured distances, this method determines how individual documents (or existing clusters of documents) are joined together to form larger branches and clusters in the tree.\n",
    "    - `\"average\"` (default): When combining two clusters, this method considers the average distance between *all* pairs of documents in the two clusters. It tends to produce well-balanced clusters.\n",
    "    - `\"single\"`: Joins clusters based on the *closest* pair of documents between them. This can sometimes lead to \"chaining,\" where documents connect one after another, forming long, straggly branches.\n",
    "    - `\"complete\"`: Joins clusters based on the *farthest* pair of documents between them. This tends to produce more compact, spherical clusters, ensuring all documents within a cluster are relatively similar to each other.\n",
    "    - `\"ward\"`: This method aims to minimize the increase in \"variance\" (or spread) within clusters when they are merged. It tries to make clusters that are as \"tight\" and internally similar as possible. Often produces intuitive and well-structured clusters.\n",
    "    * Many other methods are available. You can find a full list in the SciPy documentation for `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`.\n",
    "- `labels`: This is simply the list of descriptive names for your documents (e.g., \"Poe\", \"Lippard\") that we defined earlier. These will appear as the leaves (endpoints) on your tree.\n",
    "- `orientation`: Controls the direction of the dendrogram.\n",
    "    - `\"top\"` (default)**: Branches extend downwards from the top.\n",
    "    - `\"bottom\"`: Branches extend upwards from the bottom.\n",
    "    - `\"left\"`: Branches extend rightwards from the left.\n",
    "    - `\"right\"`: Branches extend leftwards from the right.\n",
    "- `color_threshold`: If set, branches with a distance below this threshold will be colored differently from those above it. This helps visualize clusters at a certain distance level. You can try a number like `1.0` or `1.5` to see its effect.\n",
    "- `show`: Controls whether the generated tree figure is displayed directly in this Jupyter Notebook cell.\n",
    "    - `True`: The tree will appear right below the code cell.\n",
    "    - `False` (default): The tree will not be shown immediately. This is useful if you just want to save the figure to a file without displaying it in the notebook. If you set `show=False`, remember to call `dendrogram.showfig()` later to display it.\n",
    "- `title`: Adds a title to your dendrogram plot.\n",
    "- `figsize`: A tuple `(width, height)` in inches to set the size of the overall figure. For example, `(12, 8)` for a wider and taller plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you've generated the tree, let's talk about how to read it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree you see is a **dendrogram**, a type of tree diagram that shows hierarchical clustering. Each line is a **branch** on the the tree and connects either to another branch or to a **leaf** (a terminal branch). Each leaf represents an individual document and is labelled with that document's name. Leaves connected to other leaves form clusters, or **clades**, and these may be joined to other clades, forming \"super-clusters\" at the next level in the tree's hierarchy. Branch length indicates the **distance** or **dissimilarity** between the documents in a clade and those that form part of the same \"super-cluster\". Shorter branches mean that the documents or clusters are more similar to each other based on their linguistic features. Longer horizontal branches mean that the clades are further apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following procedure is useful in reading the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the leaves (your document names) and move up the hierarchy towards the root of the tree. Look for the first merges.\n",
    "2.  As you move further up the hierarchy, you'll see larger branches forming, grouping together sets of documents or smaller clusters. These broader groupings represent larger patterns of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the dendrogram above, you might observe that \"Henry\" and \"Irving\" are clustered together with a relatively short branch length, suggesting a linguistic similarity. Then, perhaps \"Poe\" joins that cluster, indicating it's somewhat similar to the Henry/Irving group but less so than they are to each other. \"Lippard\" might be an outlier, joining the main cluster with a much longer branch, indicating it's quite distinct linguistically from the others.\n"
