    "### Generating the Bootstrap Consensus Tree (BCT):\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create the BCT, we need to tell it how to build and combine these trees. Here are the key parameters you can adjust:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dtm`: The \"linguistic spreadsheet\" (`dtm`) that we created in the previous step.\n",
    "- `metric`: This tells the tree how to measure the \"distance\" or dissimilarity between your documents. Shorter distances mean more similar documents. The default value \"euclidean\" is good for general comparisons but can be sensitive to the overall length of documents. Other common values are \"cosine\", often a good choice when documents vary considerably in length, and \"cityblock\" (Manhattan distance), which is useful when the individual differences in term counts are important. For further discussion, see the documentation on Hierchical Agglomerative Clustering.\n",
    "- `method`: The criterion used to join clusters to form larger branches and clusters in the tree. Possible values are \"average\" (the default), \"single\", \"complete\", and \"ward\".  The default \"average\" tends to produce well-balanced clusters. Single linkage often produces \"chaining\" of adjacent documents, whereas complete linkage tends to ensure that all documents within a cluster are relatively similar. Ward linkage tries to make clusters as \"tight\" and internally similar as possible. For further discussion of these options, see the documentation on Hierchical Agglomerative Clustering.\n",
    "- `cutoff`: This is a confidence threshold. Since a BCT is built from many individual \"bootstrap\" trees, a `cutoff` of `0.5` (50%) means that a specific grouping of documents (a branch on the tree) must appear in at least 50% of all the trees generated in each iteration to be considered reliable enough to show up in the final consensus tree. Higher `cutoff` values will result in a \"sparser\" tree, showing only the most robust and consistent relationships. Lower `cutoff` values will show more relationships, but some of these might be less statistically reliable.\n",
    "- `iterations`: The number of \"bootstrap resampling\" rounds. In each round, Lexos takes a random 80% sample of the terms (columns) from your DTM and builds a tree from that sample. More iterations will make the consensus tree more statistically reliable and representative of the underlying relationships in your documents, as it averages out more variations. However, it will take longer to compute. Since fewer iterations will be faster, a lower number is good for quick testing or initial explorations. Setting `iterations` to 100 or higher is recommended for final research results if computation time allows.\n",
    "- `replace`: This determines how the terms are sampled during each iteration. If set to \"with\", a term column can be selected multiple times within a single 80% sample (which allows for more randomness). The default setting \"without\" means that each term column can only be selected once per 80% sample (which is more stable).\n",
    "- `doc_labels`: A list of labels to use for the leaves (endpoints) on your tree. The list should have the same order as the names in your DTM.\n",
    "- `text_color`: Sets the color for all text on the plot (axis labels, branch lengths, and document labels). You can use \"rgb(R, G, B)\" format, such as `\"rgb(0, 0, 0)\"` (black) or `\"rgb(255, 0, 0)\"` (red).\n",
    "- `title`: A title to place at the top of the plot.\n",
    "- `layout`: Sets the layout style of the dendrogram. Possible values are \"rectangular\" (the default) and \"fan\".\n",
    "- `showfig`: Controls whether the generated tree figure is displayed automatically. If set to `False`, the diagram will not be displayed immediately. The default is `True`.directly in this Jupyter Notebook cell.\n"

    "### Interpreting Your Bootstrap Consensus Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've generated the tree, let's talk about how to read it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree you see is a **dendrogram**, a type of tree diagram that shows hierarchical clustering. Each line is a **branch** on the the tree and connects either to another branch or to a **leaf** (a terminal branch). Each leaf represents an individual document and is labelled with that document's name. Leaves connected to other leaves form clusters, or **clades**, and these may be joined to other clades, forming \"super-clusters\" at the next level in the tree's hierarchy. In the rectangular layout, branch length indicates the **distance** or **dissimilarity** between the documents in a clade and those that form part of the same \"super-cluster\". Shorter branches mean that the documents or clusters are more similar to each other based on their linguistic features. Longer horizontal branches mean that the clades are further apart. In the fan layout, branch length is irrelevant since it is scaled to allow all leaves to end at the circumference of a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following procedure is useful in reading the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the leaves (your document names) and move up the hierarchy towards the root of the tree. Look for the first merges.\n",
    "2.  As you move further up the hierarchy, you'll see larger branches forming, grouping together sets of documents or smaller clusters. These broader groupings represent larger patterns of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the dendrogram above, you might observe that \"Henry\" and \"Irving\" are clustered together with a relatively short branch length, suggesting a linguistic similarity. Then, perhaps \"Poe\" joins that cluster, indicating it's somewhat similar to the Henry/Irving group but less so than they are to each other. \"Lippard\" might be an outlier, joining the main cluster with a much longer branch, indicating it's quite distinct linguistically from the others."

This adjustment is already part of the Lexos code for the tree, but you can override it if you need a specific size.\n",
