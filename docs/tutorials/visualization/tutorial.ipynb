    "Digital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of their application. DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing. It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.\n",

    "By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. A distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation.\n",

    "D3 word clouds, bubble charts, and multiclouds can be modified with titles, limits, and settings for height and width (in pixels) using the same keywords we available in the pure Python implementations we have seen above. There is an `include_js` keyword that allows you to specify whether you would like to load the D3 Javascript over the internet or include it in your file. If you do the latter, you will have a bigger file. If you choose the former, you will not be able to view your chart without an internet connection. Generally, you can leave the default settings and read the documentation if you need to make changes.\n",

    "In either case, the D3 code will be \"minified\" to and not readable by humans. However, the main logic is left unminified, along with the HTML and styling. If you wish to open a chart file in an editor, you can make modifications that aren't enabled directly by the Lexos programming interface. However, this requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and D3, so we won't go into any further details in this tutorial."
