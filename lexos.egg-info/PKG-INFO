The Lexos API is a library of methods for programmatically implementing and extending the functionality in the <a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/" target="_blank">Lexos</a> text analysis tool. Eventually, the web app will be rewritten to use the API directly. The goal of this alpha stage of development is to reproduce (and in some cases extend) the functionality of the current web app.

## üìñ Documentation

A full discussion of the use of the API can be found on the [Documentation](https://scottkleinman.github.io/lexos/) website.

A suite of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/scottkleinman/lexos/tree/main/tests/notebooks).

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

<li>Loads texts from a variety of sources.</li>
<li>Manages a corpus of texts.</li>
<li>Performs text pre-processing ("scrubbing") and splitting ("cutting").</li>
<li>Performs tokenization and trains language models using <a href="https://spacy.io/" target="_blank">spaCy</a>.</li>
<li>Creates assorted visualizations of term vectors.</li>
<li>Generates topic models and topic model visualizations using <a href="https://github.com/mimno/Mallet" target="_blank">MALLET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser" target="_blank">dfr-browser</a>.</li>

An expanded set of features is planned for the future.

## ‚è≥ Installation

```bash
pip install lexos
```

To update to the latest version, use

```bash
pip install -U lexos
```

Before using Lexos, you will want to install its default language model:

```bash
python -m spacy download xx_sent_ud_sm
```

This is a minimal model that performs sentence and token segmentation for a variety of languages. If you want a model for a specific language, such as English, download it by providing the name of the model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

For information on how Lexos uses language models, see <a href="https://scottkleinman.github.io/lexos/tutorial/tokenizing_texts/" target="_blank">Tokenizing Texts</a>.

If you are working in another language or need a larger language model, you can download instructions for additional models from the <a href="https://spacy.io/models" target="_blank">spaCy models</a> page.
